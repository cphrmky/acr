ACR: Auto Conf Replacement
==========================

ACR tries to replace autoconf functionality generating a full-compatible
'configure' script (runtime flags). But using shell-script instead of m4.
This means that ACR is faster, smaller and easy to use.

ACR is released under the GPLv2 license. (please read the file called 'COPYING')

If you're fetching ACR from CVS, please, make clean before cvs up.

If you have new ideas, features, comments, tips, etc, please, feel free
to inform them to me at: pancake@nopcode.org
