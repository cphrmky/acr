Using acr with version control systems:
=======================================

I heard some people talking about the conflicts between cvs/svn and autoconf.

IMHO this is not a autoconf problem, is just a developer problem. The main
problem of using control versions and auto build systems is that you can
subst some tags from one file and acr will make a backup from the original
file with name : (old-name).orig

If you up/ci your repository these files will be obviously modified, and
may result on corrupt sources with diff tags like rows ("=====>") or
erroneous commits.

To fix this tips, I recommend to use always SUBDIRS, and be aware if you
use SUBST_FILES because it creates backups and overrides the original content
of the file.

Just type "-mv -f (file).orig (file)" into your Makefile's /clean/ target and
don't forget to type "make clean" before each cvs update!

Also remember that cleaning this, your modified files will be lost, be
aware, and modify only the .orig files when they exists, and re-run ./configure
