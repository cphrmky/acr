GNU make
========

GNU make extends the syntax for the original Makefiles allowing you
to use some interesting expressions.

If you're using gnu makefiles in your project you must specify't
in your configure.acr configuration file by adding this line:

USE_GMAKE

This flag makes configure script fail if no gnu make program is found
on your system. So, you must re-define the MAKE variable on each
Makefile by adding this line at top of each Makefile.acr:

MAKE=@MAKE@

This will make run happy on BSD systems (for example) where 'make'
command is not the GNU one, wrapping the concurrent calls to 'gmake'.
