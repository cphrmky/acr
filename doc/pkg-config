pkg-config with ACR
===================

You can easily create .pc files for your program by adding a simple template
file like this in your project:

--- libfoo.pc.acr
# Package Information for pkg-config

prefix=@PREFIX@
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=@LIBDIR@
includedir=@INCLUDEDIR@

Name: @PKGNAME@
Description: Your description
Version: @VERSION@
Libs: -L${libdir} -Wl,-R${libdir} -lfoo
Cflags: -I${INCLUDEDIR}
---

You must add the following line in your Makefile.acr:

--- Makefile.acr
install:
	${INSTALL_DATA} libfoo.pc ${LIBDIR}/pkgconfig/
---

And of course...you must handle this file into the configure.acr:

--- configure.acr
SUBDIRS libfoo.pc ;
---
